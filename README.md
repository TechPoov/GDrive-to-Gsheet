GDrive-to-GSheet V1.0 Overview
==============================

GDrive-to-GSheet is a lightweight TechPoov utility that scans any Google Drive folder and generates a clean, structured, clickable report in Google Sheets.

No installation, scripting knowledge, or admin rights required.

It's simply a powerful organizational tool for maintaining a clean and well-documented Drive structure.

The tool supports scanning Files, Folders, or Both, applies depth limits through MaxDepth, and runs reliably even during long multi-level scans. User-added columns (Tags, Comments, Notes, Category, subcategory ) are automatically preserved across runs, allowing long-term organization and maintenance.
